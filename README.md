MediumMenu
====================

Medium 1.8.168 menu in Swift. That is still one of my favorite menus because that is easy to use and looks beautiful.

Inspired by [RBMenu](https://github.com/RoshanNindrai/RBMenu). I made that a reference and customized a fine point.

## Demo

##Installation

1. The easiest way to get started is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
# The following is a Library of Swift.
pod 'MediumMenu'
```

2. Due to the lack of choice whether status bar is hidden or not,  Edit info.plist in your project. 

3. Add "Status bar is initially hidden" and "View controller-based status bar appearance" in info.plist as key. Eash value is "YES" and "NO".

In the rest of the details, refer to MediumMenu-Sample project. 

## Description

MediumMenu is really similar to menu of real Medium for iOS.
